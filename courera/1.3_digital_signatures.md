# digital signatures 
  * just like a signature on paper but in digital form 
  * Only you can sign, but anyone can verify 
  * signature is tied to a particular document 
    * can't be cut and pasted to another doc

# how do you build a digital signature? 
  * APIs required 
    * generateKeys(keysize)
      * creates a secret key and a private key that is created based on teh keysize parameter 
    * sign(sk,message)
      * outputs a signature 
    * verify(pk,message,sig)
      returns a boolean and checks if the signature is legit or not

# requirements for signatures
  * once a signature is made there should be a way for us to verify the signatures validity 
  * you cannot forge signatures 
    * someone else can look at your signature and know your PK but not be able to reporoduce that same signature.  It should be impossible unless they have your secret key

* need good source of randomness in order to create good and safe pk and sk pairs

* ECDSA 
  * bitcoin uses ECDSA digital signature standard
  * need really good randomness because if not then you'll leak your secret key
